Subject: Request for supervision for my final-year project: Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis for Russian Financial Texts  

Dear Dr. Edwin Simpson, 

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sirui Zhong, and I am writing to request your co‑supervision (alongside an academic in Computer Science) for my summer project. Your work in computational linguistics and natural language processing aligns closely with my project interests, and I would appreciate the opportunity to develop this idea with the benefit of your input.

I work autonomously, require minimal guidance, and proactively resolve challenges through independent research. My strong organisation, initiative, and clear communication ensure steady progress without placing significant demands on supervisory time or support.

My proposed topic is Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis for Russian Financial Texts. This project focuses on cross-lingual transfer, with the core task being to construct a sentiment analysis model to process Russian financial texts, whose performance is enhanced by leveraging English-language financial data (resource-rich) and advanced cross-language migration techniques.

During my undergraduate studies, I majored​ in Finance and minored​ in Russian at Beijing Foreign Studies University, which is known for its language education. Through my minor, I received foundational training in linguistics and language structure. My interest in computational linguistics was sparked during the last teaching block, and I have since taken relevant courses and got good marks, including Programming in C (70/100) and Computer Architecture (76/100).  

To test the feasibility of this idea, I have already taken the following steps:  
1. Pulled English financial datasets and fine-tuned XLM-R-base and FinBERT on the English data.  
2. Built a Russian financial test set of 2k headlines, annotated for 3-way sentiment. 
3. Trained a zero-shot baseline (XLM-R trained on English data, evaluated on Russian).  

This is my GitHub page with all the dataset I collected so far.

I believe this project aligns well with research in low-resource cross-lingual NLP and sentiment analysis, and I am eager to refine it under your supervision. Would you be open to discussing this further or providing guidance on how to proceed?  

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,  

Sirui Zhong

ps. I have cc'd Sion in as he recommended I contact you.
